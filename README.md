## ðŸ’¡ Site intro

This site is Shao Yen's portfolio website, it's also a simple demonstration of HTML/CSS. The site includes a navigation bar, an About Me section, a Skill section, a Project section and a Contact section.

* The Navigation Bar links in navigation bar trigger the UI scrolls down to its respective sections.
* The About Me section: there are two divisions (left and right) and they change the warping diection when it's viewed on a smaller size of a screen.
* The Skill/Project sections: There are three/five divisions in the Skill/Project sections. When you mouse over skill or project images, there's a hover animation that tells you what you are focus on. The skills images are not clickable so the mouse stays an arrow. The Project images can be linked to an external website URL so the mouse changes to a clickable icon. Image/title enlarged as well. When you resize the page or view the site on different screens or sizes, the responsive layout adapts.
* The Contact Me sections: There are five divisions in the Contact Me section. Email is also linkable. When you resize the page or view the site on different screens or sizes, the responsive layout adapts.
